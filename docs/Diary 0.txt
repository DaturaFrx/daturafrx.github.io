4 months until school is fully over.
I know I'm fully ready for what's coming, everyone says you'll never be 100% ready for anything, but I know I am.

Although, yes, I'm not ready physically.
I hiked with my family one day up El Cerro Colorado, I know now I will suffer during PT but not with push ups.

I've gotten really good doing push ups but I'm scared of doing squats, maybe it's just temporary but it's lasted various months now. I hurt my back, it felt horrible, each time I use my back to pick up something simple I can sometimes feel the lower pain.
It's not normal pain but like a needle being pushed in.
