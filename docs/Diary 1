date$$16022025$$

I've tried starting a diary multiple times, blogs even. I never commit to them but always say I will.

With this code I've made, all of the thoughts I want out there will be visible to absolutely anyone that wants to.

It's late, I've got stuff to do tomorrow, I didn't do anything today because I was up late and didn't have the energy for today, everything kinda piled up.
I'll prevail, I always do.

PD: Fix the date, I didn't set it up to my time zone and it says this was published 15 02 2025 instead of 16 02 2025
